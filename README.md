# Rlog 📜📊 

> **A personal log of my journey learning R, shared as both a learning record and a demonstration of my R skills.**  

Welcome to **Rlog**, a repository where I document my progress in learning the **R programming language**. This repo serves as:
- A personal archive of my **R Markdown** notes and study materials.
- A showcase of my **R knowledge** for recruiters and hiring managers.
- A continuously evolving resource as I expand my expertise in R.

---

## 📖 About This Repository  

I started learning R by taking structured notes in **R Markdown** format and generating them as **HTML reports**. These notes cover various topics in R, including:
- **R programming essentials**  
- **Data visualization** using `ggplot2`
- **Statistical analysis** and modeling (to come)
- **Data wrangling** with `dplyr` (to come)

Some notes include **code snippets and references from external sources** that I used during my learning journey. For example, while studying **R graphics**, I referred to *Hadley Wickham’s online book on ggplot2*.  

As I continue improving my R skills, I will keep expanding this repository with **new insights, techniques, and advanced R concepts**.

   - Clone the repo:  
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:tsunsian/Rlog.git
     ```
   - Open an `.Rmd` file in **RStudio**.
   - Click **Knit** to render it as an HTML report.
   - Modify and experiment with the R code as you learn!
